# guessing-game-rust
A simple number guessing game implemented in Rust as an introduction to basic programming concepts.

This project is a classic number guessing game written in Rust, following the official Rust Book’s tutorial. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, prompts the user for guesses, and provides feedback on each guess (“too high”, “too low”, or “correct”). It demonstrates fundamental Rust concepts, including:
Using variables and mutability
Reading user input from the terminal
Pattern matching with match and enums
Error handling with Result types
Adding and using external crates (rand)
Writing basic loops and conditionals
Great for anyone new to Rust who wants hands-on experience with a real-world beginner project!
